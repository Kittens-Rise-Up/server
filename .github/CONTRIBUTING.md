## Setup
1. .NET is installed from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0 (cross platform) or with Visual Studio if you check the `.NET desktop environment` workload when installing.
2. Head on over to the [web server](https://github.com/Raccoons-Rise-Up/website/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#setup) and make sure you generated the `private.key` and `public.key`
3. Copy this `public.key` from the web server and paste it in `bin\Debug\net5.0` (if you don't see these folders you need to run the project at least once with `dotnet run`)
4. Run the project with `dotnet run`
