## What is this?
A multi-threaded console / game server that handles logging, user commands, database and ENet connections for Raccoons Rise Up clients.

I have tried using several networking libs in the past, none of them worked out for me.
- Unity's 2019 LLMAPI has little documentation and unexplained behavior
- Godot's server-client model requires Godot to be built from open source which led me to several issues
- Mirror has to be created within Unity 2019 LTS, it cannot be used in a dotnet console app

The only networking lib that stood out to me is [ENet-CSharp](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ENet-CSharp), I find it to be very simple and straight forward. Since the original repository has their issues closed, you'll find that [this repository](https://github.com/SoftwareGuy/ENet-CSharp) has theirs open and there are many people willing to help you with any questions you may have.

I previously created a [game-server](https://github.com/The-MMORPG-Project/game-server) for [The MMORPG Project](https://github.com/The-MMORPG-Project/website) but it did not follow thread safety and depended on an external API for the console. This game-server follows thread safety and does not depend on any external API for the console.
